      The genre started roughly a decade ago among a loose network of artists who
      repurposed last-century drum machines and samples for its signature mellow
      sound. But in the past few years, lo-fi artist Celín Carlo-Gonzalez said,
      its audience has changed — from aural tinkerers on SoundCloud to crowds of
      listeners on YouTube and Spotify seeking unobtrusive music for working,
      studying or doing nothing at all. The tracks blur productivity and leisure,
      with labels such as

          she said. But she got to college and honed her skills. Her music
          appeared on top playlists — and one day, spilled over from YouTube and
          Spotify into the physical world. A friend told her he heard one of her
          tracks at a Starbucks in Costa Rica. About a year ago, she started
          hearing lo-fi leaking out of Bay Area coffee shops and at least one bar.
          To most listeners, it’s probably surprising her track was recognized at
          all: Lo-fi’s grainy, instrumental beats have grown successful — and
          infamous — precisely for their undifferentiated sound.

          Workers use music as an “aural cocoon,” to tune out distractions, to
          switch between tasks, to relax or to focus, Lesiuk said. The standard
          formula may look like this: A person is stressed. She chooses the music.
          The music helps regulate her mood, which has a positive effect on
          cognition, which has a positive effect on productivity.
