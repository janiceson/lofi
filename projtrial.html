          The genre started roughly a decade ago among a loose network of artists who
          repurposed last-century drum machines and samples for its signature mellow
          sound. But in the past few years, lo-fi artist Celín Carlo-Gonzalez said,
          its audience has changed — from aural tinkerers on SoundCloud to crowds of
          listeners on YouTube and Spotify seeking unobtrusive music for working,
          studying or doing nothing at all. The tracks blur productivity and leisure,
          with labels such as

              she said. But she got to college and honed her skills. Her music
              appeared on top playlists — and one day, spilled over from YouTube and
              Spotify into the physical world. A friend told her he heard one of her
              tracks at a Starbucks in Costa Rica. About a year ago, she started
              hearing lo-fi leaking out of Bay Area coffee shops and at least one bar.
              To most listeners, it’s probably surprising her track was recognized at
              all: Lo-fi’s grainy, instrumental beats have grown successful — and
              infamous — precisely for their undifferentiated sound.

              Good work music doesn’t inspire feelings that are too positive or too
              negative. Music with lyrics is usually distracting. A slower tempo
              should help relax you; a faster one will amp you up (think workout

              Workers use music as an “aural cocoon,” to tune out distractions, to
              switch between tasks, to relax or to focus, Lesiuk said. The standard
              formula may look like this: A person is stressed. She chooses the music.
              The music helps regulate her mood, which has a positive effect on
              cognition, which has a positive effect on productivity.

          Mix these desired effects together, and you may get something like lo-fi.
          Its slow tempo, lack of words and especially its dependence on nostalgia can
          be, for at least a few million listeners, a powerful aid to relaxed work.

          <br />
          If you cycle through enough playlists, YouTube may start directing you
          toward other instrumental throwbacks to work to, from the faux cassette-tape
          grain of lo-fi to vintage video-game soundtracks, designed as they were to
          be looped indefinitely over focused tasks.
